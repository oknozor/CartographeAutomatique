### Introduction to Cartographe Automatique

Cartographe Automatique is a Roselyn SourceGenerator designed to streamline the process of mapping between C# types. By annotating your source and target classes with specific attributes, it generates type-safe, performant, and dependency-free mapping methods. This eliminates boilerplate code and ensures maintainable, consistent mapping logic throughout your application.

#### Key Features
1. **Attributes for Flexible Configuration**:
  - **`MapToAttribute`**: Defines a mapping from a source class to one or more target classes.
    - Configurable properties include:
      - `Exhaustive`: Ensures all properties of the target type are mapped.
      - `MappingStrategy`: Specifies whether the mapping uses property setters or a constructor.
  - **`MapFromAttribute`**: Defines a mapping from a source type to the current class.
  - **`MappingAttribute`**: Allows customization of individual property mappings, such as:
    - Renaming properties.
    - Targeting specific fields or types.

2. **Primitive and Collection Type Conversion**:
  - Built-in support for implicit conversion of primitive types and common collection types (e.g., arrays, lists) between source and target classes.

3. **Generated Mapping Methods**:
  - Methods are generated based on the provided attributes, ensuring type safety and optimal performance.

### Example: Mapping with Custom Property Names and Strategies

Below is an example showcasing how to use Cartographe Automatique to map between classes with different property names and mapping strategies:

#### Code Example

```csharp
[MapTo(typeof(Car), MappingStrategy = MappingStrategy.Constructor)]
[MapTo(typeof(Bike), Exhaustive = false)]
public class Vehicle
{
    [Mapping(TargetType = typeof(Car), TargetField = "CarColor")]
    [Mapping(TargetType = typeof(Bike), TargetField = "BikePaint")]
    public string Color { get; set; }

    public string Brand { get; set; }

    [Mapping(With = "ConvertKilometersToMiles", TargetType = typeof(Car))]
    public int KilometersDriven { get; set; }

    private static int ConvertKilometersToMiles(int kilometers) => (int)(kilometers * 0.621371);
}

public class Car
{
    public string CarColor { get; }
    public string Brand { get; }
    public int MilesDriven { get; }

    public Car(string carColor, string brand, int milesDriven)
    {
        CarColor = carColor;
        Brand = brand;
        MilesDriven = milesDriven;
    }
}

public class Bike
{
    public string BikePaint { get; set; }
    public string Brand { get; set; }
}

public class MappingExample
{
    [Fact]
    public void Should_Map_Vehicle_To_Car_And_Bike()
    {
        var vehicle = new Vehicle
        {
            Color = "Red",
            Brand = "Yamaha",
            KilometersDriven = 100
        };

        var car = vehicle.MapToCar();
        var bike = vehicle.MapToBike();

        Assert.Equal("Red", car.CarColor);
        Assert.Equal("Yamaha", car.Brand);
        Assert.Equal(62, car.MilesDriven);

        Assert.Equal("Red", bike.BikePaint);
        Assert.Equal("Yamaha", bike.Brand);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Features in the Example

1. **Attributes in Action**:
  - The `MapTo` attributes on the `Vehicle` class configure mappings to both `Car` and `Bike` classes.
  - The `Mapping` attribute customizes specific property mappings:
    - `Color` maps to `CarColor` in the `Car` class and `BikePaint` in the `Bike` class.
    - `KilometersDriven` is converted to `MilesDriven` using a custom method `ConvertKilometersToMiles`.

2. **Mapping Strategy**:
  - The `Car` class uses the `Constructor` mapping strategy to initialize immutable properties.
  - The `Bike` class uses the default `Setter` strategy, where properties are assigned directly.

3. **Implicit Type Conversion**:
  - Primitive types, like `int`, are implicitly handled during the conversion of `KilometersDriven` to `MilesDriven`.

4. **Generated Methods**:
  - The `MapToCar` and `MapToBike` methods are automatically generated, encapsulating the mapping logic efficiently.
